# Lox Language Interpreter

This is a personal implementation of the Lox programming language interpreter, based on the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Bob Nystrom. The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of interpreters, language design, and Java â€” and to showcase it as part of my software development portfolio.

## ðŸ“š About the Project

Lox is a dynamically-typed, object-oriented language with syntax similar to JavaScript. This interpreter is written in **Java**, following the structure and guidance of the "Crafting Interpreters" book.

The project includes:

- A scanner (lexer) that tokenizes source code.
- A parser that builds an abstract syntax tree (AST).
- An interpreter that executes the code.
- Error handling and a basic REPL (interactive prompt).

This implementation is focused on the tree-walk interpreter approach.
